# Northern Irish migration study

## 1 Overview

This repository contains empirical data and analysis on Northern Irish migration that complements a [recent article](/references/scotlands-populaiton-needs-and-migraiton-policy.pdf) published by the Scottish government on migration policy. The article essentially looked for a regionally tailored system of migration for their own country. They found the economic cost of reduced migration, particularly due to the impact of Brexit, would be in the region of almost Â£5bn per year by 2040. The same analysis should be done for Northern Ireland.

The purpose of this repositorty is to produce a number of models, charts and graphics that complement the Scottish study for the case of Northern Ireland.
